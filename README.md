# Rock-Paper-cisors cats edition!
this a classic rock paper scisors game with a twist, you are cats !
you need to defeat the other cat in a game of rock paper scisors, the first one to score 3 points win!

this is a side project I made to learn web developement. this was the first project I made using javascript, as I only used html and css before.
it helped gain insight on how I can use javascript as a programing languange, to solve real problems and make algotihms. I learned how to manipulate the dom and create events on a web page.
